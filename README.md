# Introduction

A simple color palette generator built on Angular. [https://kevintrankt.com/palette](http://kevintrankt.com/palette)

The web application generates four colors for a palette at every reload. Colors within a palette can be locked. The application will generate colors similar to the locked colors. Users can also enter their own hex color codes in to generate colors based on their input.

The current generation algorithm produces pretty soft colors. I plan on changing the algorithm to utilize machine learning to generate colors based on other color palettes.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally and install dependencies with npm :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevintrankt/palette.git
cd palette
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
